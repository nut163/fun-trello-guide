# Card Cover Images 🖼️

In Trello, you can set a cover image for your cards to make them visually distinctive. This can be especially useful when you want to quickly identify a card or when you want to add a bit of personality to your board. 🎨

## How to Set a Card Cover Image 📝

1. Open the card you want to add a cover image to.
2. Click on the "Cover" button in the right menu. 🖱️
3. You can choose an image from your computer, Trello's stock photos, or a link from the internet.
4. Once you've selected your image, click "Save". 💾

And voila! Your card now has a cover image. 🎉

## Tips and Tricks 🎩

- Use cover images to visually categorize your cards. For example, you could use different images for different types of tasks. 📚🔧🎨
- Keep in mind that cover images will be cropped to fit the card. Choose images that will look good in a small, rectangular format. 🖼️
- You can also change the cover image of a card by dragging and dropping an image directly onto the card. It's as easy as pie! 🥧

So go ahead, give your Trello cards a makeover with some cool cover images! 🌈
