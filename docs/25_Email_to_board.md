# Email to Board 📧➡️📋

Trello provides a unique feature that allows you to forward emails to a unique board email address to convert them into cards. This is a great way to ensure that important emails don't get lost in your inbox and are instead turned into actionable items on your Trello board. 🎯

## How to Use Email to Board 🤔

1. Open the board you want to forward emails to. 📋
2. Click on the `Show Menu` button on the top right corner of the board. 🖱️
3. Click on `More` and then `Email-to-board Settings`. 📧
4. Here, you'll find a unique email address for your board. Any emails sent to this address will be converted into cards. 💌

## Tips and Tricks 🎩✨

- The subject of your email will become the card's title, and the body of the email will become the card's description. 📝
- You can even add attachments to your email, and they will be added to the card as well. 📎
- Remember, the email address is unique to each board, so make sure you're sending your email to the correct board. 🎯

So, next time you receive an important email that needs action, just forward it to your Trello board and watch it transform into a card! 🪄🃏

Happy Trello-ing! 🎉
