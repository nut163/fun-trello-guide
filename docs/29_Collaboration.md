# Collaboration 🤝

Trello is not just about managing your tasks, it's about working together! With Trello's collaboration feature, you can share your boards with team members or collaborators to work together seamlessly. 🎉

## How to Share a Board 📤

1. Open the board you want to share.
2. Click on the "Invite" button at the top of the board.
3. Enter the email address or Trello username of the person you want to invite.
4. Click "Send Invitation". 💌

Now, your collaborator will receive an invitation to join your board. Once they accept, they can view and edit the board just like you! 🙌

## Collaboration in Action 🎬

When you collaborate on a board, you can:

- See each other's changes in real-time. 🔄
- Leave comments on cards for discussions. 💬
- Mention each other in comments to send notifications. 🔔
- Assign tasks to each other. 📝
- And much more!

So, start collaborating and make your projects more fun and efficient! 🚀

Remember, teamwork makes the dream work! 💪🌟
