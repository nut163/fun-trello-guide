# Move Cards Between Boards 🚚🃏🔄

Trello allows you to move cards between different boards. This is especially useful when you need to reorganize tasks or transfer them to a different project or area of focus. 🎯🔄

## How to Move a Card Between Boards 📝

1. Open the card you want to move. 🃏
2. Click on the "Move" button in the right menu. 🖱️
3. In the "Board" drop-down menu, select the board you want to move the card to. 📋
4. You can also choose to move the card to a different list in the new board using the "List" drop-down menu. 📂
5. Click on the "Move" button to confirm. ✅

And voila! Your card has been moved to the new board. 🎉🚀

## Things to Keep in Mind 🧠

- When you move a card to a new board, all of its data, including checklists, comments, and attachments, will be moved as well. 📦
- If the card has members, they will also be moved with the card. However, if they are not members of the new board, they will be added to it. 👥
- Labels do not carry over when you move a card to a new board. If you want to keep the labels, you will need to recreate them in the new board. 🏷️

Moving cards between boards is a powerful feature that can help you keep your tasks organized and flexible. So go ahead, give it a try! 🚀👍
