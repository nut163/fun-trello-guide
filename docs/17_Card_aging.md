# Card Aging 🕰️

Card aging is a super cool feature in Trello that helps you keep track of inactive or neglected cards. It's like a gentle nudge to remind you of tasks that might have slipped off your radar. 📡

## How to Enable Card Aging Power-Up 🚀

1. Open the board where you want to enable the Card Aging Power-Up.
2. Click on the `Show Menu` button on the top right corner of the board. 
3. Click on `Power-Ups`.
4. Find `Card Aging` in the list of Power-Ups and click on `Enable`.

Now, your cards will visually age with inactivity. The more inactive a card, the more faded it becomes. 🌫️

## Types of Card Aging 🔄

Trello offers two types of card aging:

1. **Regular Mode**: In this mode, cards become progressively more transparent with inactivity.
2. **Pirate Mode**: Arr matey! In this mode, cards will tear and crack like an old pirate map. 🏴‍☠️

You can switch between these modes in the Card Aging settings.

Remember, a card is considered inactive if it hasn't been viewed in a week. So, keep an eye on those aging cards and make sure no task is left unattended. 👀

Happy organizing with Trello! 🎉
