# Copy Cards 📋🔄

Sometimes, you might find yourself needing to create multiple instances of the same task. Instead of manually creating each card from scratch, Trello allows you to duplicate or copy cards. This can be a real time-saver! 🕒💡

## How to Copy a Card 📋➡️📋

1. Click on the card you want to copy.
2. From the card's menu, select "Copy".
3. You can choose to keep the same members, labels, checklists, and attachments in the copied card.
4. Click "Create Card" and voila! Your card is copied. 🎉

## Things to Note 📝

- The copied card is created in the same list as the original card. You can move it to another list or board as needed.
- Comments are not copied to the new card. If you need to keep the comments, consider using the 'Clone' Power-Up.

So, next time you find yourself creating the same card over and over, remember the copy feature! It's like having your own card-making machine. 🏭🃏

Happy duplicating! 🎊
