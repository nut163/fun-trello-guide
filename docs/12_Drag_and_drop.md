# Drag and Drop 🖐️🔽🔀

Trello allows you to rearrange your cards and lists by simply dragging and dropping them. This feature is super handy when you need to change the order of tasks or move a task to a different stage. 🚀

## How to use Drag and Drop? 🤔

1. Hover over the card or list you want to move. 🖱️
2. Click and hold the left mouse button. 🖱️⬇️
3. Drag the card or list to its new position. 🖱️🔀
4. Release the mouse button to drop the card or list. 🖱️⬆️

And voila! Your card or list has been moved. 🎉

## Example 📖

Let's say you have a card in the "To Do" list that you want to move to the "Doing" list. Simply click and hold the card, drag it over to the "Doing" list, and release the mouse button. The card will now appear in the "Doing" list. 📋➡️📋

Remember, you can also rearrange the order of cards within a list or the order of lists within a board using the same drag and drop method. It's all about giving you the flexibility to manage your projects the way you want. 🔄🆓

So go ahead, give it a try! It's as easy as drag, drop, and done! 🖐️🔽🔀✅
