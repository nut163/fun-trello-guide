# Card Templates 📑

Card templates in Trello are a fantastic way to streamline the creation of recurring tasks. Instead of creating a new card from scratch each time, you can create a template with predefined fields and use it as a starting point. This can save you a lot of time and ensure consistency across your tasks. 🚀

## How to create a card template? 🛠️

1. Open the board where you want to create the template.
2. Click on the `+` button next to the list's name where you want to add the template.
3. Click on `Create template` in the dropdown menu.
4. Fill in the card details as you would for a regular card. You can add a title, description, labels, checklist, and more.
5. Click on `Create` to save the template.

Now, whenever you need to create a new card of the same type, you can use this template as a starting point. Just click on the `+` button, then `Create from template`, and select the template you want to use. 🎉

## Example 📖

Let's say you have a weekly team meeting and you want to create a card for each meeting with the same structure. You can create a template with a checklist of items to discuss, a due date for the meeting, and a label for easy identification. Then, each week, you can create a new card from this template and just fill in the specific details for that week's meeting. Easy peasy! 🍋

Remember, card templates are all about making your life easier and your work more efficient. So, use them to your advantage! 🏄‍♀️
