# Mentions in Trello ðŸ“£

Mentions in Trello are a great way to grab someone's attention. You can mention other Trello users in comments to notify them about a task, a new idea, or simply to start a discussion. It's like saying "Hey, check this out!" but in a more professional way. ðŸ˜Ž

## How to Mention Someone? ðŸ‘¥

To mention someone in a Trello card, follow these steps:

1. Open the card where you want to mention someone.
2. Click on the 'Comment' section.
3. Type '@' followed by the username of the person you want to mention. As you start typing, Trello will suggest usernames based on the letters you've typed.
4. Select the person from the dropdown list.
5. Write your comment and hit 'Save'.

The person you mentioned will receive a notification about your comment. It's a great way to ensure that your message doesn't get lost in the shuffle. ðŸ“¬

## When to Use Mentions? ðŸ¤”

Mentions are particularly useful when:

- You need someone's input or feedback on a task.
- You want to assign a task to someone.
- You want to notify someone about an update or change in a task.

So, next time you want to catch someone's attention in Trello, just give them a mention! ðŸ“¢
