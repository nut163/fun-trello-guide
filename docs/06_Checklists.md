# Checklists 📝

Checklists in Trello are a fantastic way to break down larger tasks into manageable subtasks. They help you keep track of your progress and ensure nothing gets missed. 🎯

## Creating a Checklist ✅

To create a checklist in a Trello card, follow these steps:

1. Open the card where you want to add the checklist.
2. Click on the "Checklist" button in the right menu.
3. Enter a title for your checklist and click "Add".

Now, you can start adding items to your checklist! 📋

## Adding Items to a Checklist 📌

To add an item to a checklist:

1. Click on the checklist you want to add an item to.
2. Type your item in the "Add an item..." field.
3. Press Enter or click "Add".

You can add as many items as you need. Each item represents a subtask related to the main task represented by the card. 🧩

## Checking Off Items ✔️

As you complete subtasks, you can check them off in the checklist:

1. Click on the checkbox next to the item you've completed.

You'll see a progress bar at the top of the checklist showing how many items have been completed. It's a satisfying way to see your progress! 🚀

## Deleting a Checklist 🗑️

If you no longer need a checklist, you can delete it:

1. Click on the checklist you want to delete.
2. Click on the "Actions" button at the top right of the checklist.
3. Click "Delete".

Be careful, though! Deleting a checklist is permanent and can't be undone. 🚫

Checklists are a powerful tool in Trello to help you manage your tasks and stay organized. So, start creating checklists and ticking off those tasks! 🎉
