# Card Dependencies 🧩

Trello allows you to establish dependencies between cards using the Hello Epics Power-Up. This is a great way to manage tasks that are dependent on each other. 🔄

## How to Use Hello Epics Power-Up 🚀

1. First, you need to enable the Hello Epics Power-Up for your board. Go to the `Menu` > `Power-Ups` > then find `Hello Epics` and click `Enable`.

2. Once enabled, you can create dependencies by clicking on a card to open it, then click on the `Hello Epics` button on the right menu.

3. In the Hello Epics panel, you can select other cards that this card is dependent on, or cards that depend on this card. 🎯

4. You can also see a tree view of all the dependencies of a card. This is super helpful to understand the flow of tasks. 🌳

Remember, a card can have multiple dependencies and can be dependent on multiple cards. It's all about how your tasks are interconnected! 🕸️

## Why Use Card Dependencies? 🤔

Using card dependencies can help you better manage your projects. It allows you to:

- Understand the order of tasks and what needs to be done first. 📝
- See the impact of a delay in one task on other tasks. ⏰
- Make sure no task is forgotten or overlooked. 🕵️‍♀️

So, start using card dependencies and make your project management more efficient! 🚀🎉
