# Filter Cards in Trello 🕵️‍♀️🔍

Filtering cards in Trello is like having a superpower! 🦸‍♀️ It allows you to view cards based on specific criteria such as label, member, or due date. This can be incredibly helpful when you're dealing with a large number of cards and need to focus on specific tasks. Let's dive into how you can use this feature! 🏊‍♀️

## How to Filter Cards 🗂️

1. Open the board you want to filter. 📋
2. Click on the "Show Menu" button on the right-hand side. 🖱️
3. Click on the "Search Cards" option. 🔍
4. Enter your filter criteria in the search bar. You can filter by labels, members, due dates, and more! 🏷️👥⏰

## Examples 🌟

- To filter by label, you can enter `label:"your label name"` in the search bar. For example, `label:"Urgent"` will show all cards with the "Urgent" label. 🏷️🔥
- To filter by member, you can enter `@username` in the search bar. For example, `@john` will show all cards assigned to John. 👥👤
- To filter by due date, you can enter `due:day` in the search bar to show all cards due today. Or use `due:week` for cards due this week. ⏰📅
